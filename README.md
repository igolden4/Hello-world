# Hello-world
Just another cotton-pickin' repository

<p>I'm feeling pretty weird right now because I'm drinking cough syrup because I'm sick but I'm also drinking coffee because I need to be caffeinated. I'm cross-faded and hazy.</p>

<p> Allison, if you're reading this, I'm hacking as hard as I can to save you. </p>
